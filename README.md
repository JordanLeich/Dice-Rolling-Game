# Dice-Rolling-Game
This a game where the user plays against an opponent and two random dice are rolled. Whoever has the higher random dice total wins the round in a total of five rounds. The user can also play a game called "Quads" which is where the dice roll totals for each round are quadrupled to avoid less draws!
